# Spell Checker Application

## Brief Description

An application built in C++ which makes use of _Tries_ as the primary data structure. It provides the user with a suitable suggestion for a misspelled word in a custom text.

## Details

- This project is basically a spell checker application that will help the user to identify the correct spellings of a word by giving a suitable (closely match) suggestion.<br>

- For example, if a user enters the word 'staike' or 'stakei', the program will provide suggestions of appropriate words that would be “stack” in above case.
             
Also in addition to Spell Checker, we’ll introduce word play like “Anagram solver”, in which user will enter some random letters and in return the program will list all the possible words that can be created from the user entered random letters. We’ve put some options like the program will ask user to enter 4,6 or 8 letters words. The program will in return produce the result out of these 4,6 or 8 letter words depending upon user’s choice. Also there is a game in which the program will itself produce some random letters and user has to make all possible words out of the given words. We’ll calculate score and time for each user who would play game and store the result in highest order.
